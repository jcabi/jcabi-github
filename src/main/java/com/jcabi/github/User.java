 * Github user.
 *
 * @author Yegor Bugayenko (yegor@tpc2.com)
 * @version $Id$
 * @since 0.1
 * @see <a href="http://developer.github.com/v3/users/">User API</a>
 * @todo #1:1hr Fetch list of emails of a user. Let's implement
 *  a new method emails() that returns an instance of class UserEmails with
 *  a few methods: 1) iterate() returning a list of strings, 2) add(String),
 *  and 3) remove(String). Let's use the
 *  new response format suggested by Github:
 *  http://developer.github.com/v3/users/emails/#list-email-addresses-for-a-user
 *  This new UserEmails interface should be implemented by GhUserEmails,
 *  tested in a unit and integration tests. Besides that, we should
 *  implement MkUserEmails class.
 * @todo #1:1hr Public keys of a user. Let's implement a new method
 *  keys(), which should return an instance of interface PublicKeys. This
 *  interface should have at least methods 1) iterate() to list all public
 *  keys of a user, 2) get(String) to get a single public key, 3) remove(String)
 *  to remove a key. Every key should be an instance of interface PublicKey,
 *  extending JsonReadable and JsonPatchable. All of the new classes should
 *  be implemented with GhPublicKeys and GhPublicKey classes. We should
 *  create integration and unit tests, and implement MkPublicKeys
 *  and MkPublicKey classes.
