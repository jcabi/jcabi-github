 * @todo #416 Implement a Smart decorator for PullComment for the purposes of JSON
 *  parsing. This class should be able to return the various attributes of the
 *  JSON response for fetching comments, such as the ID, commit ID, URL, and
 *  comment body. Smart should also be able to handle editing the attributes
 *  of an existing comment by using
 *  {@link JsonPatchable#patch(javax.json.JsonObject)}. Also include an example
 *  of how to do this in the Javadoc comment above. You can refer to
 *  {@link PublicKey} on how to do this.
