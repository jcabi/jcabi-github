Respect Limits

  GitHub has limits for number of request per hour. It
  sets following headers describing current state of rate limit in each
  response: <<<X-RateLimit-Limit>>>, <<<X-RateLimit-Remaining>>>, and
  <<<X-RateLimit-Reset>>>. For further information see
  {{{https://developer.github.com/v3/#rate-limiting} API Documentation}}.

  If you want to control limits, you can use
  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/github/wire/CarefulWire.html}<<<CarefulWire>>>}}
  class for it. If <<<X-RateLimit-Remaining>>> of received response is less than
  a given threshold,
  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/github/wire/CarefulWire.html}<<<CarefulWire>>>}}
  will sleep until a time specified in the <<<X-RateLimit-Reset>>> header.

  You can use
  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/github/wire/CarefulWire.html}<<<CarefulWire>>>}}
  with
  {{{./apidocs-${project.version}/com/jcabi/github/GitHub.html}<<<GitHub>>>}}:
